The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected results occur due to unit inconsistencies or operator precedence issues. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely fail because of the missing 'px' unit for the 10. Another issue arises when combining `calc()` with other CSS properties that might be unexpectedly prioritized. For example, a mix of `calc()`, `min-width`, and `max-width` can lead to counter-intuitive results unless the interactions are thoroughly understood.
